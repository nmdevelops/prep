<h1>Temporary Nomad</h1>
    <p>I didn't start travelling until I was in my thirties. I didn't feel driven to it. I didn't feel much of anything.</p>
    <p>I accidentally discovered that travel was a means of therapy.  Of unearthing my broken parts.  Of finding replacements. Of becoming whole again.</p>
    <p>This story is still being written, and will continue until I die. Like so many others
       have, I continue to find peace and resolution through connection with human beings, the nature we exist within, and our history of monumenting our moment of existence upon it.</p>

       <p>This travel is what brought me back to life, pulled me out of a pit that I had fallen into.  I met a broken, intelligent, narcissist.  My Father.  A man who I knew little of, and
       had been curious throughout my life about.  He and my stepmother helped me break poor eating habits (as did france generally). I built simple routines over two months of walking 10,000 steps and eating prepared meals.
       We argued nearly daily. I found some respect for him. I felt he had some for me but little for my experience thus far in life.</p>
